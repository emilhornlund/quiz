/**
 * Modal for viewing and removing players from an active game session.

 * Responsibilities:
 * - Fetches current players via {@link useGameContext} (`getPlayers`) and renders them as {@link NicknameChip}s.
 * - Allows selecting a player for removal by clicking the chip delete button.
 * - Shows a {@link ConfirmDialog} to confirm removal.
 * - On confirmation, triggers a short "shake" animation for the selected player, then calls `leaveGame`.
 *
 * Fetch behavior:
 * - Only fetches players when `open` becomes true.
 * - Clears local state when `open` becomes false to avoid stale data on next open.
 *
 * Removal flow:
 * 1. User clicks delete on a chip -> `playerToRemove` is set.
 * 2. Confirm dialog opens (`open={!!playerToRemove}`).
 * 3. User confirms -> chip gets `shake` animation immediately.
 * 4. After 500ms:
 *    - Confirm dialog closes (clears `playerToRemove`),
 *    - `loading` is enabled,
 *    - `leaveGame(playerId)` is executed,
 *    - on success the player is removed from the local list,
 *    - optionally re-fetches players with `getPlayers()` to reconcile with backend truth,
 *    - `loading` is disabled when the promise settles.
 *
 * Timer cleanup:
 * - Any pending removal timeout is cleared on unmount and when closing the modal.

 * Creates and appends a new `PLAYER` participant to the given game document.

 * Special rules:
 * - In Lobby, the initial rank is `0`.
 * - When joining after Lobby, the rank is set to the next rank after the highest existing player rank.
 * - In ZeroToOneHundred mode, when joining after Lobby, the initial total score is the current average

 * @param game - The game document to mutate.
 * @param participantId - The unique participant identifier to assign to the new player.

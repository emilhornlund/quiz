/**
 * Scheduled service that refreshes the discovery snapshot twice daily.

 * Fires at 06:00 and 18:00 UTC via `@Cron('0 0 6,18 * * *')`. Each
 * invocation delegates to {@link DiscoveryComputeService.compute}, which
 * scores all eligible quizzes, applies the per-rail dedupe policy, and
 * atomically replaces the singleton snapshot document.
 *
 * A distributed lock (`discovery_snapshot_lock`, 30 s timeout) ensures that
 * only one instance across the cluster executes the compute pipeline per
 * trigger, preventing duplicate writes and wasted work.
 *
 * When the `DISCOVERY_SEED_ON_INIT` environment variable is set to `true`,
 * the service also runs a one-time compute pass during application startup
 * (via `OnModuleInit`). This is useful for seeding an initial snapshot after
 * deploying a new environment before the first scheduled cron tick fires.

A full‑stack quiz game platform built with a modern monorepo setup. It features a shared type system, a NestJS backend, and a Vite‑powered React frontend.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** v24 (Active LTS) or higher
  We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) to manage your Node versions.

- **Yarn** v1.22.22 or higher  
  Install via `npm install --global yarn` if you don’t already have it.

- **Git**  
  To clone and manage the repository.

- **Docker & Docker Compose** (optional)  
  If you prefer to run your database and cache in containers.

## Monorepo Structure

This project uses [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) to manage multiple packages:

```text
klurigo/
├── packages/
│   ├── common          # Shared models and utilities
│   └── klurigo-service # Backend service (NestJS)
│   ├── klurigo-web     # Frontend app (Vite + React)
```

## Scripts

The root `package.json` contains orchestration scripts for development, building, and testing:

**Scripts:**

- `yarn dev` – Run frontend, backend, and Storybook in parallel.
- `yarn serve` – Serve both frontend and backend builds.
- `yarn build` – Build all packages.
- `yarn clean` – Clean all packages.
- `yarn lint` / `yarn lint:fix` – Run linting across all packages.
- `yarn test` – Run all tests concurrently.
- `yarn prepare` – Initialize `husky` (if configured).

## Packages

### [`@klurigo/common`](./packages/common)

Shared models and validation logic between the backend and frontend.

- Outputs both CommonJS and ESM modules.
- Consumed by `@klurigo/klurigo-web` and `@klurigo/klurigo-service`.

**Scripts:**

- `yarn build` – Clean and compile.
- `yarn lint` / `yarn lint:fix` – Lint the codebase.

### [`@klurigo/klurigo-web`](./packages/klurigo-web)

Frontend application built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Storybook**.

**Features:**

- Vite dev server and production builds.
- Component testing with Vitest.
- Storybook integration for UI components.

**Scripts:**

- `yarn dev` – Start the Vite dev server.
- `yarn build` – Production build.
- `yarn serve` – Preview the built app.
- `yarn test` / `test:watch` / `test:update` – Run tests.
- `yarn storybook` / `build-storybook` – Start or build Storybook.
- `yarn lint` / `lint:fix` – Lint the codebase.

### [`@klurigo/klurigo-service`](./packages/klurigo-service)

Backend API built with **NestJS**, using SSE for real‑time updates.

**Features:**

- Game state and lifecycle management.
- Shared types from `@klurigo/common`.
- Jest-based test suite.
- Circular dependency detection.

**Scripts:**

- `yarn dev` – Start the NestJS app in watch mode.
- `yarn build` – Compile for production.
- `yarn serve` – Run the compiled app.
- `yarn test` / `test:watch` / `test:coverage` – Run backend tests.
- `yarn check-circular-deps` – Check for circular imports.
- `yarn lint` / `lint:fix` – Lint the codebase.

---

## Development

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:emilhornlund/klurigo.git
cd klurigo
yarn install
```

To start everything in dev mode:

```sh
yarn dev
```

### Running individual workspaces

```sh
# Backend
yarn workspace @klurigo/klurigo-service dev

# Frontend
yarn workspace @klurigo/klurigo-web dev

# Storybook
yarn workspace @klurigo/klurigo-web storybook
```

### Local infrastructure helpers

Spin up **MongoDB** and **Redis** containers the quick way:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

The default `docker-compose.yml` provides sensible development‑only images with exposed ports matching the backend configuration.

---

## End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

The frontend application includes end-to-end tests written with **Playwright**. These tests run against the real frontend and backend, using a dedicated test database and Redis instance that is automatically reset and seeded before execution.

### Prerequisites

Playwright requires browser binaries to be installed once on your machine.

```sh
yarn workspace @klurigo/klurigo-web playwright install
```

On Linux (for example in CI), system dependencies may also be required:

```sh
yarn workspace @klurigo/klurigo-web playwright install --with-deps
```

### Run locally

```sh
yarn workspace @klurigo/klurigo-web test:e2e
```

This will:
- Start the frontend (Vite dev server)
- Start the backend in test mode
- Reset and seed MongoDB and Redis
- Run Playwright tests across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit

### CI behavior

End-to-end tests are **disabled by default** in CI and are only executed for selected workflows (for example on `main` and production deploys).

---

## CI/CD & Deployment

All build, test, release, and deployment steps are now handled automatically by **GitHub Actions**. On every push and pull request the pipeline validates the codebase, and on merges to `main` it:

1. Builds the frontend and backend Docker images.
2. Runs the test suites.
3. Tags the images with the current commit SHA and a semver tag (on release).
4. Pushes artefacts to the configured container registry.
5. Updates the production environment via the deployment workflow.
